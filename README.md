# DaliBoard

Fetch data from a fixed URL and displays each object as a marker on the map.  
Basic interactive features involving a switch to display more details about a member  
and filter markers based on search input (member name).  

I learned React Native to create this simple app.
There were a lot of resources to learn from, but setting up was definitely the toughtest part.

## Instructions for Build
1) Open `DaliBoard.xcworkspace` with `XCode` and build.  
* go to `XCode` workspace settings  
* click advanced  
* set `Path relative to Workspace`  
* change all fields with `Build/Products` to `build/Build/Products`  


2) Install `react-native` and `react-native-cli`  
. clone this repo  
. `npm install`  
. `npm start`  
. `react-native run-ios`

You can run it on your device (https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device)
